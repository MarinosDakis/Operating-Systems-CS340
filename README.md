# Operating-Systems-CS340

### The following folders contain projects that I've completed throughout the semester for my CS340 Operating System's class:

The [**Time**](https://github.com/MarinosDakis/Operating-Systems-CS340/tree/master/Time) project involves calculating the total amount of time that a command takes to perform via a pipe.

The [**Threaded Dynamic programming**](https://github.com/MarinosDakis/Operating-Systems-CS340/tree/master/Threaded%20Dynamic%20programming) project uses multi-threading to find the minimum number from 10000 random integers.
Essentially, the main threads creates 5 threads that are bound by 2000 intervals from the initial 100000 numbers.
Each of the 5 threads creates an additional 20 threads that each find the minimum from an interval of 100 integers and stores them in an array.

The [**Best fit simulation**](https://github.com/MarinosDakis/Operating-Systems-CS340/tree/master/Best%20Fit%20Simulation) project simulates the best fit algorithm which also implements compression to satisfy the issue of external fragmentation.
